CONDITIONS:
//////////

IF,ELIF,ELSE

• Basically, a condition needs to return True, so that our script continues with the code in its block.
• The three important keywords here are if, elif and else.

if number < 10 :
    print ( "Your number is less than 10" )
elif number > 10 :
    print ( "Your number is greater than 10" )
else :
    print ( "Your number is 10" )

• In this script, our first if-statement checks if number is less than 10. (comparisons always return True or False) If the return is True, the code that is indented here gets executed.
• We use colons and indentations to mark code blocks in Python.
• If this condition returns False, it continues to the elif-block and checks if this condition is met.
• You can have as many elif-blocks as you want.
• If no condition is met, we get into the else-block.

NESTED IF-STATEMENTS:
////////////////////

if number % 2 == 0 :
    if number == 0 :
        print ( "Your number is even but zero" )
    else :
        print ( "Your number is even" )
else :
    print ( "Your number is odd" )

• So, here we have the first condition, which checks if the number is even. When it's even it then checks if it's a zero or not.
